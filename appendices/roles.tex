\chapter{Role Specific Contact Details}
Certain roles have contact details (email address and, in some cases, a telephone number) that are specifc to that role. These contact details, summariesed in \autoref{tab:rolecontacts}, will always ensure that your communications reach the relevant person(s) in that role. Where possible, you should endeavour to use the role-specific email address to contact the person(s) in that role. This ensures that, as different people fill the roles, the correct person will always be contactable.
