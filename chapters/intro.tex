\chapter{Introduction}

This operations manual exists to provide Student Robotics\footnote{Student Robotics is a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales, with registration number 1163168.} volunteers with guidance so that they may work within Student Robotics to pursue its mission (see chapter~\ref{chapter:mission}).  It defines and describes every role that exists within the organisation, along with the powers that are associated with them.

It is not expected that every volunteer should need to know the whole contents of this manual, but instead should be well versed in the sections that are relevant to their role.

It is likely that the contents of this manual will change over time.  The process through which this happens in detailed in section~\ref{sec:ops-man-update-procedure}.
