\chapter{General Operations}


\begin{itemize}
\item Operations of SR are divided into a set of roles
\item Each role is assigned a set of responsibilities, some of which may include managing a set of subordinate roles
\item Every volunteer must be in a role to play a part in SR (there are no ``wildcard'' roles)
\item There is a set of general responsibilities that every person in a role has:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Providing periodic summaries of activities to superior via email, at a rate that is determined through conversation with superior.
  \item Responding to queries from superior
  \item Working with others that their superior has required they work with
  \item Assisting their superior in achieving their superior's responsibilities as requested by their superior
  \end{itemize}
\item Roles with subordinates have these responsibilities too:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item All responsibilities of all individuals below them in the org chart
    \item Selecting capable subordinates if there are any in the org chart
    \item Keeping a list of people in subordinate roles
    \item Ensuring subordinates (if any) are:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Suitably qualified for, and capable of, delivering their assigned responsibilities, and replaced if they are not
      \item Suitably informed
      \end{itemize}
    \item Delegating and managing responsibilities appropriately to immediate subordinates
    \item Ensuring that no subordinate is subject to stress or abuse due to their participation in this project
