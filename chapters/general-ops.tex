\chapter{General Operations}


\begin{itemize}
\item Operations of SR are divided into a set of roles
\item Each role is assigned a set of responsibilities, some of which may include managing a set of subordinate roles
\item Every volunteer must be in a role to play a part in SR (there are no ``wildcard'' roles)
\item There is a set of general responsibilities that every person in a role has:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Providing periodic summaries of activities to superior via email, at a rate that is determined through conversation with superior.
  \item Responding to queries from superior
  \item Working with others that their superior has required they work with
  \item Assisting their superior in achieving their superior's responsibilities as requested by their superior
  \end{itemize}
\item Roles with subordinates have these responsibilities too:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item All responsibilities of all individuals below them in the org chart
    \item Selecting capable subordinates if there are any in the org chart
    \item Keeping a list of people in subordinate roles
    \item Ensuring subordinates (if any) are:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Suitably qualified for, and capable of, delivering their assigned responsibilities, and replaced if they are not
      \item Suitably informed
      \end{itemize}
    \item Delegating and managing responsibilities appropriately to immediate subordinates
    \item Ensuring that no subordinate is subject to stress or abuse due to their participation in this project
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Org Chart}

\begin{itemize}
\item The chart in Figure~\ref{fig:org-chart-top} shows the set of roles within the organisation, and their relation to their superiors and subordinates. This is not a complete organisational chart, but rather the set of top-level organisation wide roles. More detailed charts are shown in the relevent sections of this document.
\item Description of responsibilities of every role (\textit{Notes incomplete on this at this moment}), including the following for every role:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Title
  \item Objectives
  \item Responsibilities
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
