\section{Teams}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Every team must have a responsible adult associated with them, who is referred to as the ``team leader''.  This is usually a teacher from the school that the team is a part of.

\item The majority of a team must be aged between 16 and 18 inclusive.

\item Team applications:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Teams should be able to apply to take part in the competition.
  \item Applications for participating in the next SR year should start to be taken after the current competition event has finished.  Previous teams and potential teams should be notified that this registration process has begun.
  \item Whilst a potential team may be recruited by a \role{local-team-coord}, the team leader must still apply to take part in the competition.
  \item There are a limited number of places for teams in the competition, and in general these should be awarded to those who apply on a first-come, first-served basis.  The trustees may provide further guidance on how teams are to be allocated -- for example, efforts may be made to increase diversity of teams, and so some teams may be prioritised over others.

  \end{enumerate}

\item If a team drops-out during the year, then efforts should be made to reallocate their kit to a new team who is not currently participating in the competition.  If there is no new team to replace them, then the kit should be provided to one of the largest currently-participating teams, so that they may split into two teams.

\end{enumerate}
