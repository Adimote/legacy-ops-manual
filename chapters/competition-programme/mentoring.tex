\section{Mentoring}

SR works with many 16-18 year-olds, the vast majority of whom have never participated in an engineering project before.  If left entirely to their own devices, many teams would give up before realising their full potential.  To avoid this from happening, SR provides teams with support through a mentoring programme.  Each team is assigned a mentor, who's role it is to help the team achieve their full potential within the competition.

Mentors must be 18 years old or over.  They must also possess skills that will help to further the teams' learning and understanding of engineering, science and team work. For example a mentor may be an engineering or science undergraduate, graduate or professional (note that this example is not an exhaustive list).

Since a mentor's main activity involves visiting a team on a regular basis, they will not generally meet other SR volunteers very often.  Therefore regular mentor socials are run by each \roletitle{local-team-coord}.  These socials allow mentors to discuss their mentoring activities with other mentors, as well as enjoy themselves!

\subsection{How to Mentor}
Every team that participates in SR is different, and so each team needs mentoring in a slightly different way.  What is crucial, in all situations, is that a mentor does not end up doing the team's work for them.  The mentor is a consultant, not a servant to the team.

When first starting to mentor a team, it is sensible to start off with a reasonably hands-off approach.  Start by asking the teams questions that are likely to make them think about the work that they have ahead of them, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item How is the team going to organise itself?
\item What do they think their schedule is going to look like?
\item How much time do they actually have to spend on the project?
\item What sort of process are they going to use to develop their robot?
\end{itemize}

In order to successfully mentor a team, a mentor should meet up with that team on a regular basis.  This should ideally be in person, but does not have to be.  Mentoring by email, instant-messaging, etc. are all completely acceptable ways of assisting a team.  However, despite the hopes of many engineers and computer scientists, these technologies are still far less effective than meeting in person.  During these meetings, a mentor can help their team identify issues that they are having, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Technical issues (i.e. design and implementation problems)
\item Problems they are having with the SR kit or services.
\item Issues with coordinating their team.
\end{itemize}

Whilst a mentor can provide a great deal of support to a team, that team will benefit greatly if the mentor encourages them to participate in the online SR community.  Through this community, the team may interact with other teams and SR volunteers.  This provides them with an effective support system.

In order to ensure that SR provides the best service it can to teams, each mentor should report to their \roletitle{local-team-coord} when they have visited a team.  The \roletitle{local-team-coord} will be able to assist the mentor in their role, and ensure that the mentor is happy.

Sometimes, a mentor will not be able to make a meeting with their team.  Since teams sometimes fall into the belief that their mentor is their only source of support, it is important that the mentor makes their \roletitle{local-team-coord} aware that they are unable to attend.

From time-to-time, a mentor will encounter a problem that they do not know how to resolve.  When this situation arises, they should post a question on the forum, provided that it does not personal information.  When the forum is not appropriate, they should talk to their \roletitle{local-team-coord}, who will help them to work out how to resolve the issue.

As with all SR volunteers, mentors must comply with the DBS checking requirements described in section~\ref{sec:dbs-checking}.

\textit{The following paragraph is still being developed, as the maximum travel expense has not yet been set.}  SR will reimburse a mentor's travel expenses up to a maximum of {\pounds}N per week for travel to and from meetings with their team between the dates of kickstart and the competition.  These expense claims must comply with the requirements specified in chapter~\ref{chapter:money-matters}.

\subsection{Local Team Coordination}

\textit{This will be covered in the Local Team Coordinator's role section, but there should be some more detail here.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Local Mentor Socials:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Mentors should be given the opportunity to meet each other socially reasonably regularly.  In order to not significantly burden the mentor's schedule, these meetings should be appropriately infrequent (e.g. every month).
  \item These meetings should be informal, and social in nature.
  \item Other local SR volunteers who are not mentors should also be invited to attend these socials.
  \end{itemize}

\item School Recruitment
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It is the \role{local-team-coord}'s responsibility to recruit schools from the local area.
  \item Advice on recruiting schools:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Send letters to schools as a start (\textit{Include a template letter in this document.}).  Follow up with a phone call after 2-4 weeks if no email response is received.
    \item Contact well in advance of expected start: will take many months to set up a team at a school.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\item Communications with schools
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It is the \role{local-team-coord}'s responsibility to communicate with the team leader, and to redirect their communications as appropriate.  The \roletitle{local-team-coord}'s 
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
