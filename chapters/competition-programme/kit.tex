\begin{enumerate}

\item The philosophy behind the kit:

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item The vast majority of the competitors will never have engineered any software, nor anything mechanical or electronic.  Asking them to build a robot from scratch, without giving them any support in these areas would, in most cases, not be useful.  It would not be enjoyable for them, as they would likely end up believing that they could not achieve anything.

    \item SR provides a kit to teams.  The purpose of this kit is to make it feasible for completely inexperienced teams to build robots capable of competing in the competition.  This kit consists of three main parts: mechanics, electronics and software.

    \item The kit must be able to be easily constructed into a ``minimum viable robot'', which is capable of competing within the game.  The kit must contain all of the parts for this minimum viable robot, including the mechanics, electronics and software.

Not only does this minimum viable robot remove any barrier to entry, it allows teams to focus on the elements of their robot that they are most interested in (and thus enjoy the most).  For example, a team may have more of an interest in developing the electronics for their robot.
      
    \item The construction process for assembling the kit into this minimum viable robot must be straightforward.  If someone can assemble a piece of flatpack furniture, then they should be able to assemble all of the minimum viable robot (including its electronics and software).

    \item The kit should not be designed just to create a minimum viable robot, but should consist of composable modules that can be used in robots designed by teams.  

    \item Teams must not be required to use the kit to compete.  They should be able to build their robot out of whatever they like, provided that it is safe.

    \item The kit should be enjoyable for teams to use.

    \item The kit should be as close to the state of the art as possible.

    \item The kit must be rugged and robust to accidental damage.
    \item{Consist of commercial off the shelf (COTS) parts where appropriate.}

\item Requirements for kit shipping
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{Whole kits shipped in white RUBs}
    \item{Batteries in battery bags}
    \item{\pounds500 insurance on whole-kit shipping}
    \item{Battery courier instructions (approved list, labels, etc)}
  \end{enumerate}
\item Policy on kit replacement
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{\role{kit-logistics-coord} responsible for shipping replacement parts after request/authorisation from \role{kit-coord}.}
    \item{\role{local-team-coord} responsible for reporting broken/damaged kit to \role{kit-coord} for replacement.}
    \item{Any piece of kit replaced free-of-charge when damaged accidentally.}
    \item{Any piece of kit, except for batteries, replaced free-of-charge when damaged due to misuse/negligence in the first instance. Teams charged for further damage due to misuse/negligence.}
    \item{In the case of batteries damaged due to misuse/negligence no replacements will be provided and teams must dispose of the battery in question.}
  \end{enumerate}
