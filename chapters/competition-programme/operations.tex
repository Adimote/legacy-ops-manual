\subsection{Org Chart}

The chart shown in \autoref{fig:org-chart-prog} shows the set of roles within the competition programme. Note that the \role{comp-prog-coord} at the head of the chart is a subordinate of the \role{trustees} as shown in \autoref{fig:org-chart-top}. The subtree below the \role{comp-event-coord} (circled in red) is shown in \autoref{fig:org-chart-event}.

The roles shown circled in dashed blue are special in that there are multiple independent instances of these roles. For example there are multiple \roletitle{local-team-coord}s, each managing a subset of teams. The responsibilities and powers of each \role{local-team-coord} only cover the teams that they manage, therefore there is no overlap with other roles.
