\subsection{Org Chart}

The chart shown in \autoref{fig:org-chart-prog} shows the set of roles within the competition programme. Note that the \role{comp-prog-coord} at the head of the chart is a subordinate of the \role{trustees} as shown in \autoref{fig:org-chart-top}. The subtree below the \role{comp-event-coord} (circled in red) is shown in \autoref{fig:org-chart-event}.

The roles shown circled in dashed blue are special in that there are multiple independent instances of these roles. For example there are multiple \roletitle{local-team-coord}s, each managing a subset of teams. The responsibilities and powers of each \role{local-team-coord} only cover the teams that they manage, therefore there is no overlap with other roles.

  The \roletitle{game-design-coord} is responsible for game design and rule writing.
  \begin{responsibilities}
    \item Designing the game.
    \item Producing publishable rules for that game well in advance of Kickstart.
    \item Ensuring that details of the game are not publicly available until Kickstart.
    \item Updating the published rules throughout the year in response to rule clarification requests.
  \end{responsibilities}

  The \roletitle{game-design-coord} should coordinate with the \role{kit-coord} to ensure that:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The game is technically feasible with the provided kit.
    \item The technical and safety regulations within the rules have been signed-off by the \roletitle{kit-coord}.
  \end{itemize}

\end{roledesc}

\begin{roledesc}{kickstart-event-coord}
  The \roletitle{kickstart-event-coord} is responsible for running the kickstart events.

  \begin{responsibilities}
  \item Deciding where kickstart events are to be located.
  \end{responsibilities}
\end{roledesc}

\begin{roledesc}{local-ks-event-coord}
  Each \roletitle{local-ks-event-coord} is responsible for running a kickstart event.
\end{roledesc}

\begin{roledesc}{local-presenter}

\begin{roledesc}{team-coord}
  The \roletitle{team-coord} is responsible for managing the teams that participate within the competition.

  \begin{responsibilities}
  \item Team recruitment -- \textit{TODO: This needs definition.}
  \item Keeping a database of up-to-date information about each team, which must include:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Team leader's name, email address and phone number.
    \item Shipping address for the team.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Deciding which teams that have applied to enter into the competition are given places in the competition.
  \item Reallocating places in the competition if teams drop-out.

  Note that a \roletitle{local-team-coord} is \textit{not} expected to field every request that a team makes.  If a team is requesting something that is not provided as a service by SR, then it is entirely reasonable for the \roletitle{local-team-coord} to respond with a message indicating that this is not something that SR is able to assist with.
