\section{The Competition}

The competition is a fun and exciting two-day event that is run to allow teams to play their robots against other robots.  The competition also allows teams to celebrate their achievements, meet other teams, and also discover what is possible.  Unlike kickstart, the competition is held in one location, thus maximising the spectacle of the event.

\subsection{Event Structure}

From a team's perspective, the competition consists of the following sections:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Arrival.

  Teams arrive at the venue, provide the paperwork that is necessary for their entry (i.e. tickets, or media consent forms), and are shown to the location of their pit, where they may work on their robot throughout the event.

\item Introduction.

  Teams are introduced to the event through a short introduction talk.  This talk gives teams an overview of how the event will run, and ensures that they are aware of relevant safety information.

\item League Matches.

  A series of matches is run, the results of which determine the position of teams within a league.  This forms the bulk of the matches that will be played at the competition, and ranks teams so they may be seeded into the knockout.  This seeding is arranged so that the top players should meet in the final match, to maximise the excitement throughout the event.

\item Photograph of teams.

  A gap is scheduled in the league matches so that a photograph of everyone in attendance can be taken.  This is scheduled somewhere near the middle of the league matches to ensure that all teams are still present (sadly, some teams choose to go home at the end of the league if they have not achieved a high position).

\item Knockout.

  A knockout tournament is held to determine the winner of the competition.

\item Awards ceremony.

  A guest speaker awards the winning teams with their prizes, and makes a short motivational speech.

\item Kit return.

  Teams return the loaned parts of their kit to SR.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Game Orchestration}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Game Orchestration
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Shepherding:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Teams should be:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Ready for their match at the arena entrance well in advance of the match start.
      \item Reminded by shepherding volunteers when their match is due to start.
      \end{enumerate}

    \item Only one team member allowed into staging area with robot at time.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Judging
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sometimes there will be uncertainty surrounding the score a team should be awarded for a match.  This should be resolved by a judge.  Only one judge will be on duty at a time, and must:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Record any decision they have made in a journal that is to be passed to the subsequent judges who are duty.  This is to maintain consistency of decisions.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item As rules say: Judge's decision is final.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Match scorers
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Match scorers collect score data at end of game
    \item Teams may ``throw in the towel'' during a game.  In the event that a team does this, the match scorer must turn their robot off, and the team must forfeit all points from the match.
    \item Match Scorers must stay out of the arena throughout the game.  If they have to enter the arena to turn off a robot, they must take the shortest route through the arena that avoids blocking the view of other robots of the arena.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Commentating
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Maintain interest and enthusiasm throughout games.
    \item Commentators must only do a maximum of a 2 hour shift, and have a break of at least 1 hour after that.
    \end{enumerate}


  \item Lighting
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sync'ed to matches
    \item All white lights during matches
    \item Lighting effects between matches
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Music
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sync'ed to matches
    \end{enumerate}

  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Scheduling}

\item Date Selection Requirements:
  \begin{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Food and drink:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Can be purchased.

  \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tickets and Media Consent}
  \begin{enumerate}
  
\item Tickets and media consent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Everyone who attends the competition, including volunteers, must have given consent for SR to use any photographs or videos that include them.  Those who do not give such consent must not be permitted to enter the competition venue.

  \item Since there are issues in verifying whether a competitor is a minor or not, \textbf{all} competitors must get their media consent form signed by their parent or guardian.  For the purposes of media consent, all competitors must be considered to be minors.

  \item In order to both speed up entry to the venue, and also to ensure that competitors do actually sort out their media consent forms, a competitor must receive a ticket from SR for the event prior to the event.  They must only receive this ticket if they have provided a signed, valid media consent form.  They will then use this ticket to gain entry to the venue.

  \item People who are clearly adults may be permitted entry to the venue if they sign a media consent form at the door.

  \item If minors arrive at the competition without a signed media consent form or ticket, and their parent or guardian is present, then their parent or guardian may sign a media consent on their behalf.

  \item Scans or photos of signed media consent forms may be transferred electronically to SR, provided that they are legible.

  \item The contents of the media consent form must be approved by the trustees.

  \item All media consent forms received for, or at, the competition must be digitised within one month after the competition.  These digitised forms must be sent to the trustees.  After the trustees have confirmed receipt, the physical copies must then be shredded to avoid distributing personal information.

  \item A system must be employed that allows re-entry to the venue to those who have already presented with a valid media consent arrangement.  This may be done with with a wristband system, or another reasonable approach.
  \end{enumerate}

  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Awards}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Awards:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item All awards must be described within the documentation provided to teams at kickstart.
  \item The following awards must exist:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item First, second, and third prize.  The teams that receive these awards must be presented with trophies for achieving them.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Other awards may also exist, and these should be decided upon by the \roletitle{game-design-coord}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Kit return}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item After the competition event, teams must return the kit that SR loaned to them.
  \item The kit may be returned in two ways:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item At the end of the competition event itself.
    \item By courier before TODO days after the competition.  The courier service used by teams for this return must be sufficiently insured.  Teams must be provided with guidance on how to pack their kit for postage.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}


\subsection{Competition Software}

\begin{enumerate}

    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  The competition software provides this to them.

\item The competition software must also:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Provide mechanism for information from match scorers to be entered, and amended.
  \item Allow for matches to be delayed as part of the schedule.
  \end{enumerate}

\item Match Scheduling:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The competition software should allow a team's matches to be scheduled to comply with the following requirements:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item All matches in all arenas must begin simultaneously.
    \item A team's league matches should be well-distributed throughout the event.
    \item A team should face as many other teams as possible in matches throughout the league.
    \item Throughout the event, a team should experience a wide selection of initial conditions (e.g. the corner that they start in).
    \item The knockout:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Must begin with all teams
      \item Should begin in all arenas, but have quarter finals in only the main arena
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Time must be allocated between matches to allow for:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Scoring
      \item Arena reset
      \item Robot removal and installation
      \end{enumerate}
