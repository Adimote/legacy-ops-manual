\section{The Competition}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Purpose of the competition:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Fun, exciting event
  \item Allow teams to:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Celebrate their achievements
    \item See what's possible
    \item Meet other teams
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Play their robot against other teams
  \end{enumerate}

\item Event structure.  Consists of the following sections:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Arrival: Teams arrive, do entry paperwork, shown to their pit.
  \item Intro: Brief welcome talk
  \item League: Purpose is to seed knockouts
  \item Photograph of all teams
  \item League: More league matches after photo. The photo happens in the middle of league matches to prevent teams leaving early.
  \item Knockout: Find a winner!
  \end{enumerate}

\item Game Orchestration
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Shepherding:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Teams should be:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Ready for their match at the arena entrance well in advance of the match start.
      \item Reminded by shepherding volunteers when their match is due to start.
      \end{enumerate}

    \item Only one team member allowed into staging area with robot at time.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Judging
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sometimes there will be uncertainty surrounding the score a team should be awarded for a match.  This should be resolved by a judge.  Only one judge will be on duty at a time, and must:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Record any decision they have made in a journal that is to be passed to the subsequent judges who are duty.  This is to maintain consistency of decisions.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item As rules say: Judge's decision is final.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Linesmen
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Linesmen collect score data at end of game
    \item Teams may request that a linesman turns their robot off during the game -- only take this command from the one team member who brought the robot in.  Once turned off, the robot stays where it is in the arena until the end of the game.
    \item Linesmen must stay out of the arena throughout the game.  If they have to enter the arena to turn off a robot, they must take the shortest route through the arena that avoids blocking the view of other robots of the arena.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Commentating
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Maintain interest and enthusiasm throughout games.
    \item Commentators must only do a maximum of a 2 hour shift, and have a break of at least 1 hour after that.
    \end{enumerate}
