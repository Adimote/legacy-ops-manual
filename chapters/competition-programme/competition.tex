\section{The Competition}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Purpose of the competition:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Fun, exciting event
  \item Allow teams to:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Celebrate their achievements
    \item See what's possible
    \item Meet other teams
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Play their robot against other teams
  \end{enumerate}

\item Event structure.  Consists of the following sections:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Arrival: Teams arrive, do entry paperwork, shown to their pit.
  \item Intro: Brief welcome talk
  \item League: Purpose is to seed knockouts
  \item Photograph of all teams
  \item League: More league matches after photo. The photo happens in the middle of league matches to prevent teams leaving early.
  \item Knockout: Find a winner!
  \end{enumerate}

\item Game Orchestration
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Shepherding:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Teams should be:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Ready for their match at the arena entrance well in advance of the match start.
      \item Reminded by shepherding volunteers when their match is due to start.
      \end{enumerate}

    \item Only one team member allowed into staging area with robot at time.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Judging
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sometimes there will be uncertainty surrounding the score a team should be awarded for a match.  This should be resolved by a judge.  Only one judge will be on duty at a time, and must:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Record any decision they have made in a journal that is to be passed to the subsequent judges who are duty.  This is to maintain consistency of decisions.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item As rules say: Judge's decision is final.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Linesmen
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Linesmen collect score data at end of game
    \item Teams may request that a linesman turns their robot off during the game -- only take this command from the one team member who brought the robot in.  Once turned off, the robot stays where it is in the arena until the end of the game.
    \item Linesmen must stay out of the arena throughout the game.  If they have to enter the arena to turn off a robot, they must take the shortest route through the arena that avoids blocking the view of other robots of the arena.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Commentating
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Maintain interest and enthusiasm throughout games.
    \item Commentators must only do a maximum of a 2 hour shift, and have a break of at least 1 hour after that.
    \end{enumerate}


  \item Lighting
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sync'ed to matches
    \item All white lights during matches
    \item Lighting effects between matches
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sync'ed to matches

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Food and drink:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Can be purchased.

  \item Volunteers should be provided with transport to the competition from the town where they live. \textit{TODO: What constraints need to be put on this.  Cost?  Distance?  Number of volunteers?  Apply in advance?}

  \item Provide water throughout event
  \item Social event for volunteers should be organised on the Saturday evening of the event

  \end{enumerate}

  \end{enumerate}

\item Tickets and media consent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Everyone who attends the competition, including volunteers, must have given consent for SR to use any photographs or videos that include them.  Those who do not give such consent must not be permitted to enter the competition venue.

  \item Since there are issues in verifying whether a competitor is a minor or not, \textbf{all} competitors must get their media consent form signed by their parent or guardian.  For the purposes of media consent, all competitors must be considered to be minors.

  \item In order to both speed up entry to the venue, and also to ensure that competitors do actually sort out their media consent forms, a competitor must receive a ticket from SR for the event prior to the event.  They must only receive this ticket if they have provided a signed, valid media consent form.  They will then use this ticket to gain entry to the venue.

  \item People who are clearly adults may be permitted entry to the venue if they sign a media consent form at the door.

  \item If minors arrive at the competition without a signed media consent form or ticket, and their parent or guardian is present, then their parent or guardian may sign a media consent on their behalf.

  \item Scans or photos of signed media consent forms may be transferred electronically to SR, provided that they are legible.

  \item The contents of the media consent form must be approved by the trustees.

  \item All media consent forms received for, or at, the competition must be digitised within one month after the competition.  These digitised forms must be sent to the trustees.  After the trustees have confirmed receipt, the physical copies must then be shredded to avoid distributing personal information.

  \item A system must be employed that allows re-entry to the venue to those who have already presented with a valid media consent arrangement.  This may be done with with a wristband system, or another reasonable approach.
  \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
